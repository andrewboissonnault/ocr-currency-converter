# OCR Currency Converter
A currency conversion app that can also use the camera to detect prices and display their converted amounts in an overlay. Started as a project to experiment with ReactiveCocoa.

## Optical Character Recognition
This project uses the library provided by [MicroBlink](https://microblink.com/ocr) to handle real time OCR.

## Parse
There is a parse server running that contains the latest currency exchange information.

## Reactive Cocoa
Experimenting with using [ReactiveCocoa](http://www.sprynthesis.com/2014/12/06/reactivecocoa-mvvm-introduction/) bindings and MVVM architecture.
